            <div class="subtitle">Veterans Homeless Support Initiative with Community Thrift Store</div>
        </div>

        <div class="meta-info">
            <p><strong>Organization Name:</strong> [Your Organization Name]</p>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 2, 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Grant Period:</strong> [Start Date] - [End Date]</p>
            <p><strong>Amount Requested:</strong> $[Amount]</p>
        </div>

        <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
        
        <div class="mission-statement">
            <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Our organization is dedicated to providing comprehensive support services to homeless veterans through direct community engagement, a community-driven thrift store, and wraparound services that address the root causes of veteran homelessness.
        </div>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>The Veterans Homeless Support Initiative will establish a community thrift store that accepts donations from the general public and provides free essential items directly to homeless veterans through face-to-face outreach. This dual-purpose model serves as both our primary service delivery mechanism and our data collection hub, allowing us to build relationships, assess needs, and track outcomes with the veterans we serve.</p>

        <h3>Funding Request</h3>
        <p>We are requesting $[Amount] over [Time Period] to establish and operate a thrift store facility, conduct direct outreach to an estimated [Number] homeless veterans, and provide essential items, case management support, and pathways to housing stability.</p>

        <h2>STATEMENT OF NEED</h2>

        <h3>The Journey from Battlefield to Streets</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>On battlefields across Iraq, Afghanistan, and conflicts spanning generations, service members have endured unimaginable trauma. They've witnessed the chaos of combat, carried wounded brothers and sisters to safety, and made split-second decisions under fire that haunt them still. Many returned home with visible wounds—amputated limbs, traumatic brain injuries, burns, and shrapnel scars. Others carry invisible wounds—post-traumatic stress disorder, moral injury, depression, and the psychological toll of warfare that society cannot see but that weighs just as heavily.</p>
            
            <p>These warriors, who once relied on unit cohesion and military structure, often find themselves struggling to navigate civilian life. The transition from battlefield to home front can be more treacherous than combat itself. Without the framework of military service, without the camaraderie of their units, many veterans find themselves isolated and adrift. Mental health challenges go untreated. Substance use becomes a means of self-medication. Jobs are lost. Relationships deteriorate. Housing becomes unstable.</p>
            
            <p>The same veterans who answered their nation's call and stood ready to sacrifice everything now find themselves sleeping under bridges, in abandoned buildings, or on the streets of the communities they once protected. They face this battle alone, often too proud to ask for help, sometimes unaware that help exists, and frequently unable to navigate the complex systems designed to serve them.</p>
            
            <p>Our program recognizes that these veterans—wounded in body, mind, or spirit—deserve more than bureaucratic processes and institutional barriers. They deserve face-to-face human connection, immediate assistance without red tape, and a pathway back to stability that honors their service and restores their dignity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Veterans represent approximately 11% of the homeless population nationwide, despite comprising only 7% of the general U.S. population. In [Your Area], current data shows:</p>

        <h3>Budget Justification</h3>
        <p>This budget reflects the core costs of establishing and operating a thrift store-based outreach program for homeless veterans. Personnel costs represent the majority of expenses as face-to-face engagement requires trained, dedicated staff.
